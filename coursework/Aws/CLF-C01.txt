What is Cloud Computing ?
Using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data,
rather than a local server or a personal computer.

Evolution of Cloud Hosting 
Dedicated Server - Expensive, High Maintenance, High Security
VPS(1 physical machine is virtualized into sub machnines, runs multiple sites) - Better Utilization and Isolation of Resources
Shared Hosting(Shared by multiple businesses, relies on tenants under utilizing their resources) - Cheap, limited functionality, Poor isolation
Cloud Hosting(Multiple M/C that act as 1 system, distributed computing) - Flexible,Scalable,Secure

AWS
Launched in 2006(S3 in March'06, EC2 in Aug'06)

CSP 
Provides multiple cloud services, which can be chained together to create cloud architectures, accessible via Single unified API

Landscapes of CSP 
Tier-1: AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba
Tier-2: IBM, Oracle, Rackspace
Tier-3: Vultr, Digital Ocean, Linode

Common Cloud Services
Compute(EC2), Networking(EBS), Storage(RDS), Databases(VPC)

Evolution of Computing -
Dedicated - Physical server wholly utilized by a single customer.
	    Guess capacity, underutilized, cant vertically scale,
VM - Runs multiple virtual machines on 1 machine
     Hypervisor is software layer that lets you run VMs
     Pay fraction of server
     Easy to scale

Containers - VMs running multiple containers
	     Docker Deamon is S/W layer that lets you run multiple containers
	     Can maximize the utilize of available resource
	     Can run multiple apps without conflict in resource sharing

Functions - Are managed VMs running managed containers
	    Upload piece of code, choose memory and duration
            Only responsible for code and data
            Cost effective, only pay for time code is running
	    Downside - Cold start

Types of Cloud Computing - 
SAAS(For customers), PAAS(For developers, EBS, Heroku, AppEngine), IAAS(For Admins, Aws, Azure)

Deployment Models - 
Public Cloud - DropBox
Private Cloud(On-Premise, Cloud could be OpenStack)
Hybrid Cloud(On-Premise and CSP) - Banks, FinTech
Cross Cloud(Multiple CSPs, Amazon EKS, Azure Arc, GCP kubernetes) - Government,Insurance companies
